Copy-paste this prompt into the **Campaign Architect** input bar to witness the full power of the engine.

## 1. The Input (Copy this)
```text
KisanMitra: An AI-powered mobile app that allows Indian farmers to detect crop diseases just by scanning leaves with their phone camera. 
It works 100% offline, supports Malayalam and Tamil, and connects them instantly with local government agricultural experts. 
We are launching next month in Wayanad, Kerala.
```

## 2. What to Expect (The "Ah-ha" Moment)
*   **Strategy Node**: Will identify the target audience as "Smallholder farmers in Kerala" and the USP as "Offline Capability" & "Regional Language Support".
*   **Asset Explosion**:
    *   **Twitter**: A thread about "Democratizing Agritech".
    *   **Instagram**: Visual brief showing a farmer scanning a leaf.
    *   **TikTok/Reel**: A script: *"Phone edukku, Scan cheyyu!"* (Take phone, scan it).

## 3. The "Trend Jack" Test
Once the graph finishes generating:
1.  Wait for the **Live Trends** dock to appear (bottom right).
2.  Click **"Inject Trend"**.
3.  **Result**: The content will rewrite to fit the mock trend (e.g., "Barbie Style" -> "Pink Tractors? Farming is cool now.").
